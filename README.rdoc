THE SWOTBOT

SWOT (Scholars Working OverTime) Bot is a fully functioning student management system that tracks student behavior, attendance, grades and overall daily proficiency. It allows teachers, parents and students to track their progress via a live web-feed, SMS text, email and our own internal messaging system. The SWOTBot is currently being used by Scholars Working Overtime in the East Las Vegas school district.
